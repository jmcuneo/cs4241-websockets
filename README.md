Functionally, this application is the same as the initial demo, but it utilizes a "send" button instead of running every text change. However, the main change is the conversion from Svelte to React, which posed a challenge because React's state system caused the page to refresh, which would constantly re-connect the websocket. The solution to this was to organize the project so that the websocket would remain persistent, while the page's content would update normally. In terms of additional features, if a hexcode is sent, it will change the page's background color to that.
