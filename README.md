We expanded on the original demo by adding a number guessing game to the text chat. If a user connected to the chat inputs a message that's a number, it will be submitted to the server as a guess. The server will respond based on whether the number is higher or lower than the secret number stored on it (the number 333). The major challenge we faced involved getting guesses to properly send between the client and server, as well as just learning how to use web sockets.
