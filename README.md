Project Description: Our application allows each client to choose a color from a color selector and place a square anywhere on their screen. Other clients can see the colored squares made by each other in real-time.

Challenges: Besides the original problem of the page constantly auto-reloading, we had some problems with the default color of the square being placed on the screen, but we hid that problem by defaulting the square color to the background color.
