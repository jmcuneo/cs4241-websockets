# ICE 04: Websockets

Andrew Nguyen, Dov Ushman

We created a messaging web app that uses websockets. It allows two clients to run at the same time on the same port. These clients can send messages to each other and they are easily shown through text and color to differentiate between users. This app uses Svelte, Vite and express. The server also stores all the messages.

Note: This works locally and not hosted.
