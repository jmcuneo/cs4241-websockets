# ICE 04: Websockets
By Esha Bajwa, Joselin Barbosa, Jolene Pern

## Our Project 

- Our activity took the starter sockets code and added a message counter so each user can see the number of messages on their side. 
- We added a feature that changed the color of the messgaes when the user sends a message. Red means it is the users time to respond, Blue means the user just sent a message and the other user has to respond.
- We played around with the CSS styling 

## What we faced
1. As we were following the guide, we realized that we had to use two different terminals to run both the Svelte app and the server.js at the same port. 
2. Glitch Deploymet: we had issues with deployment, I wasn't untill a peer noticed that Glitch does not suport the Node.js version we needed to run our activity.
