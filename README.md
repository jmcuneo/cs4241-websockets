# ICE 04: Websockets

Team: Aidan MacNevin, Jack Lafond, Edison Zhang, Bryon Tom

This application is a set of 4 buttons starting at 100. Each click counts the button down. The goal is to be the fastest clicker to get to 0. 
We faced some difficulties with how we wanted to initialize the application. Initially we tried to get the buttons to appear with each connection but we ran into some issues for the newest connection.
