# ICE 04: Websockets

## Group Members: Nora Cleary, Ellys Gorodisch, Andrew Salls, Era Kalaja

Our application is a simple web chat service that stores and username with a message so users know who they are communicating. When sending a message the user must first enter in their name and then an additional input box will appear for the message the user would like to send. Our group faced challenges with uploading this on glitch. We discovered that the latest version needed for svelte is not available on glitch so we had to work on this locally rather than serviced. We also had challenges with displaying input boxes when we wanted to (hide and show syntax were difficult to work with svelte). Making messages persistent was difficult. 

Our messaging chain includes time stamps to inform users of the time between sends. Messages are persistent.
