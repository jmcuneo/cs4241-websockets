# ICE 04: Websockets

In this activity, you will work in groups to build a simple websockets application

### What we did

We all worked on figuring out how to correct for the mouse offset, this was relatively simple we just subtracted 50 from the values around line 30 of App.svelte.

Ivy B tried to get things to work in a droplet but that proved to be more complicated than originally thought.

Ava C: Refreshing results in a color change for the client the other person remains red.

Luca W: Wherever the mouse is, squares appear.
