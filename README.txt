Our project involves bouncing squares! You can open as many pages of the project as you want,
and you'll see the exact same bouncing squares! Plus, anyone can interact with them!
Left click a square to split it into 4 other squares (unless it's too small, then it will be destroyed).
Right click a square to make a big square (unless it's too big, then it will do nothing).
